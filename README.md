# LLM-Based Clinical Notes Section Identifier
:tada: Exciting News! Our paper titled “LLM-Based Section Identifiers Excel on Open Source but Stumble in Real World Applications” has been accepted at NAACL - Clinical NLP! :tada:
In this paper, we tackle the challenge of navigating through lengthy Electronic Health Records (EHRs) by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify semantically relevant sections in increasingly lengthy EHR notes. Our findings show that GPT-4 can effectively solve this task in both zero and few-shot settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
However, when tested on a more challenging real-world dataset, GPT-4's performance falters, indicating the need for further research and harder benchmarks.
