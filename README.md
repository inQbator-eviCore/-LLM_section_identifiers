# LLM-Based Clinical Notes Section Identifier
Electronic health records (EHR) even though a boon for healthcare practitioners, are growing convoluted and longer every day. Sifting around these lengthy EHRs is taxing and becomes a cumbersome part of physician-patient interaction. With the rise of automated methods, machine learning (ML) has shown promise in solving the task of identifying relevant sections in EHR. Large language models (LLMs) have performed impressive feats in natural language processing (NLP), that too in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any labeled data. We used LLMs to identify relevant section headers. We find that GPT-4 can effectively solve the task on both zero and few-shot settings as well as segment dramatically better than state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we also annotate a much harder real world dataset and find that GPT-4 struggles to perform well, alluding to further research and harder benchmarks.
